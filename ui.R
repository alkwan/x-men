Traditionally, the league always cluster the shot of players by the defined area of the court. However, the revolution of the training technique makes some players really crazy. Therefore, it is not quite scientific to research the shot data by the traditional court division. Therefore, we implement K-means cluster analysis to re-group the shot data of each player. We believe that clustering the shot data for each player will be beneficial to formulate the defending strategy against the player.
